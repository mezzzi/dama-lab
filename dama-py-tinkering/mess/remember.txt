Where You last stopped:

Keep on working with the MindMaster
------------------------------------
+ you were undecided as to whether to make the MindMaster simply a CompPlayer Object;
that would probably make things neat and clean
+ you were to add a rule that prioritizes becoming-king(kingification) above cheap
eats and moves
+ also you were thinking to sort of recursively check on the "eats" to see if the eating
can keep going or not. If the eating keeps going(turns into an eating-spree), it should 
get higher priority over cheaper eats.
+ Not just prioritize an eating-spree, but also balance with or check side by side so
as to minimize a possible and upcoming(retaliating) eating-spree by the enemy. Oh if you
could but have some elegant algorithm for easily identifying eating-sprees!
+ So with that it means, don't just be always chasing eats, watch out for enemy moves; so 
as much as possible try to prevent the enemy from making expensive eats(such as
eating-sprees and free-eats) and kingfication moves.
-------------
you have worked on the eatingspree file inside the mess folder.
In this file you have edited and understood the getEatPaths()
function that uses the fake_tree. Now move on to the real 
getEatPaths() and other relevant functions in that file. And
then you will have to figure out how to integrate that into
the mastermind.
